* Problem Statement
In Ethiopia, land record management remains largely manual and fragmented. This creates problems such as:
- Delays in property verification and transfers.
- High travel and documentation costs for rural citizens.
- Vulnerability to fraud due to lack of centralized digital verification.

* Planned Solution
We are developing an e-Government web application that allows citizens to:
- Securely log in using their **Fayda Digital ID (FIN/FAN)**.
- Automatically fetch verified personal data from Fayda (name, DOB, address, etc.).
- Fill and submit land-related forms (ownership, transfer, inheritance, etc.).
- Receive digital certificates and real-time application status.
-The system will also integrate with relevant government offices to validate land documents and prevent duplication or manipulation.

* Expected Outcome
- A user-friendly platform that reduces time and cost for both government and citizens.
- Streamlined land management through digital forms, secure identity, and reduced need for physical office visits.
- A prototype system with sample data to demonstrate end-to-end flow: login → data fetch from Fayda → form submission → PDF report generation.

* Fayda's Role (Recommended)
Fayda Digital ID is used as the **primary authentication and verification mechanism**:
- Users log in with their Fayda FIN or FAN.
- Biometric and demographic data are fetched automatically from Fayda's backend (via API or mock service).
- This removes the need for users to repeatedly submit physical copies of personal documents.
